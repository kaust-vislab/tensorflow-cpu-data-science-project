# tensorflow-cpu-data-science-project

Repository containing scaffolding for a Python 3-based data science project using on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) ecosystem. 

## Creating a new project from this template

Simply follow the [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a new project repository from this template.

## Project organization

Project organization is based on ideas from [_Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing_](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put external scripts or compiled programs in the `bin` directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in a `data` directory.
4. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
5. Put all Docker related files in the `docker` directory.
6. Install the Conda environment into an `env` directory. 
7. Put all notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
8. Put files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
9. Put project source code in the `src` directory.
10. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

## Building the Conda environment

After adding any necessary dependencies that should be downloaded via `conda` to the `environment.yml` file 
and any dependencies that should be downloaded via `pip` to the `requirements.txt` file you create the 
Conda environment in a sub-directory `./env`of your project directory by running the following commands.

```bash
$ export ENV_PREFIX=$PWD/env
$ conda env create --prefix $ENV_PREFIX --file environment.yml --force
$ conda activate $ENV_PREFIX
(/path/to/env)$ pip install --requirement requirements.txt # insures horovod built with compiler inside ./env    
```

For convenience these commands have been wrapped in a `bash` script which can be sourced as follows.

```
$ . bin/create-conda-environment.sh
```
  
Note that the `./env` directory is *not* under version control as it can always be re-created from 
the `./bin/create-conda-environment.sh` file as necessary.

## Verifying the Conda environment

After building the Conda environment you can check that Horovod has been built with support for 
TensorFlow and MPI with the following command.

```
$ conda activate $ENV_PREFIX # optional if environment already active
(/path/to/env) $ horovodrun --check-build
```

## Updating the Conda environment

If you add (remove) dependencies to (from) either the `environment.yml` file or the `requirements.txt` file 
after the environment has already been created, then you can update the environment with the following commands.

```bash
$ conda activate base # insures that $ENV_PREFIX environment is not active!
$ . bin/create-conda-environment.sh
```

## Using Docker

In order to build Docker images for your project and run containers you will 
need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and  
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Detailed instructions for using Docker to build and image and launch containers can be found in 
the `docker/README.md`.
